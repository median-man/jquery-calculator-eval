# jquery-calculator
A simple calculator with jQuery.

## Bugs to Fix
* order of operations with powers incorrect. 2 + 2^2 = 16. (should be 6).

## Other Features to Consider

* clicking any number after clicking '=' clears the calculator display
* clicking an operator after '=' resets the calculator and includes the clicked number as the first argument in the calculator. (Resets and renders display accordingly.)
* accept keyboard input in addition to clicking the buttons
