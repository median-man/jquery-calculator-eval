# jquery-calculator
A simple calculator with jQuery.

## Bugs to Fix
* unable to render numbers of > 1 digit

## Fixes and Features
* Fixed order of operations bug (thanks Tim!).
* Calculator can display more than 2 numbers and one operator.
* added feature: clicking any number after clicking '=' clears the calculator display before continuing.

## Adding Features
* use a new branch or the improved-calculator branch for introducing new features.
* only merge to the master branch once a the branch with the new feature has been tested.

## Other Features to Consider
* clicking an operator after '=' resets the calculator and includes the clicked number as the first argument in the calculator. (Resets and renders display accordingly.)
* accept keyboard input in addition to clicking the buttons
