# jquery-calculator
A simple calculator with jQuery.

## Fixes and Features
* Fixed order of operations bug (thanks Tim!).
* Calculator can display more than 2 numbers and one operator.


## Other Features to Consider
* clicking any number after clicking '=' clears the calculator display
* clicking an operator after '=' resets the calculator and includes the clicked number as the first argument in the calculator. (Resets and renders display accordingly.)
* accept keyboard input in addition to clicking the buttons
